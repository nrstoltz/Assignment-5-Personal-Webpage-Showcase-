# AI Dev Notes

This file logs prompts used with AI tools during development and a short reflection as required by the assignment.

## Prompt 1
Prompt: "Create a responsive multi-page personal website layout with semantic HTML and a contact form that validates password confirmation using minimal JavaScript."

AI output: Provided a sample multi-page structure (index, about, projects, contact) and a JS snippet that compared password and confirm fields on submit.

Action: Accepted with minor edits — adjusted IDs and messages to match my existing template and improved accessibility (aria-live regions).

## Prompt 2
Prompt: "Write CSS for a simple responsive navigation and card-like main content area with accessible font sizes."

AI output: Generated a CSS snippet using CSS variables and media queries.

Action: Modified — changed color variables and spacing to match my taste and adjusted breakpoints.

## Prompt 3
Prompt: "Write a short 150-word reflection about using AI tools while building a student portfolio site; mention where AI helped and where it made mistakes."

AI output: Drafted a reflection of ~160 words describing time savings, a few inaccuracies, and the need to verify outputs.

Action: Accepted after editing to 150 words and adding a personal note about verifying image file names and links.

## Reflection (150 words)
Using AI tools like Copilot sped up routine tasks such as generating boilerplate HTML, responsive CSS patterns, and a basic form validation script. This saved time and helped me focus on the content and design choices. However, AI output sometimes included mismatches with my project's filenames and accessibility details, which required manual correction. For example, the AI suggested an image filename that differed in case from my local file, which would break on some servers. I treated AI suggestions as drafts to critique: I accepted helpful structure but reviewed and improved accessibility, labels, and error messaging. The exercise taught me to keep a critical mindset—AI accelerates repetitive work but doesn't replace careful testing and design decisions. Moving forward I will continue to use AI for scaffolding while ensuring every change is validated and documented in this repo.
