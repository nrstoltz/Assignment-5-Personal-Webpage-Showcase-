                        <p>The Bloomington Parking Wizard is the Capstone project my team and I worked on for seven months during our senior year to fulfill the final requirement for our Informatics degree at Indiana University. The goal was to tackle one of Bloomington’s biggest everyday challenges: finding reliable parking. With thousands of students, faculty, and visitors commuting for classes, events, and activities, parking often becomes stressful and time-consuming.</p>

                        <p>We designed and developed a parking assistance website that helps users locate parking spots around the IU campus and downtown area. The site provides an interactive map that displays parking locations, real-time availability, hourly pricing, and operational hours. It also offers recommendations tailored to a user’s needs (proximity to destination, preferred lot type, etc.).</p>

                        <p>This project combines user-centered design with live data integration to make the parking experience more efficient and less frustrating — helping reduce citations and improving how drivers navigate Bloomington’s busy streets. The capstone was a full lifecycle team project: problem discovery, UX research, wireframing, implementation, testing, and deployment.</p>

            <div>
                <div class="project-text">
                    <p>This project was part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class focused on UX research, UI principles, wireframing, and prototyping. Over the semester our team designed a working prototype in Figma that addressed a common urban problem: finding a clean, accessible restroom nearby.</p>

                    <p>Called "The Bathroom Problem", the app targets people in Chicago ages 18–25. Team members from Chicago informed the problem selection based on lived experience. Our goal was to help users quickly locate restrooms and trust recommendations via a rating system, improving convenience and confidence for users in public spaces.</p>

                    <p>We followed the full HCI design process: user research, wireframes, low-fidelity prototypes, iterative testing, and a high-fidelity prototype built in Figma. The project emphasized research-driven design and showed how iteration and testing refine solutions before development begins.</p>
